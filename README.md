# Titanic-People-survive-prediction-ML-project
<p>It's a Kaggle competition project:

The task at hand involves delving into the historical tragedy of the Titanic sinking and constructing a predictive model. The goal is to uncover patterns within the passenger data that shed light on the factors influencing survival chances. By examining variables such as name, age, gender, and socio-economic class, the challenge is to discern which characteristics are more conducive to survival. This endeavor essentially explores the question: "What specific traits or attributes made certain individuals more likely to survive the Titanic disaster?" The challenge beckons to developing a model capable of predicting survival outcomes based on a thorough analysis of the provided passenger information.</p>
